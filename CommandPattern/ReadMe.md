# Command Pattern File Reader

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of the Command design pattern in a simple file reading application. The Command pattern encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue them, and perform various operations like logging and undoing.

## Implementation Details
- **ICommand Interface**: Defines a method `Execute()` for executing an operation. All command classes implement this interface.
- **ReadFileCommand**: A concrete command that performs the action of reading a file. It stores the file path and includes logic to read and display the file content or an error message.
- **FileOperationExecutor**: Acts as an invoker. It is responsible for invoking the command's execution method. This class could be enhanced to support operations like undo or logging.

## Usage
To read a file using this application:
1. Provide the file path in the `filePath` variable within the `Main` method.
2. Run the program. The application will create a command for reading the file and execute it through the executor.

## Advantages of the Command Pattern
- **Decoupling**: The pattern decouples the class that invokes the operation from the one that knows how to execute it, enhancing flexibility.
- **Extensibility**: New commands can be added without changing existing code, adhering to open/closed principles.
- **Complex Command Sequences**: Allows the management of complex sequences of commands, including undo, redo, and transactional capabilities.

## Conclusion
This implementation showcases how the Command pattern can organize operations, such as file reading, into distinct command objects. This structure simplifies the management of functionalities and enhances the ability to extend or modify command behaviors without altering the core application logic.
