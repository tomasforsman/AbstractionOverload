# File Reader with Decorator Pattern

This project demonstrates the use of the Decorator design pattern to enhance a basic file reading application. The Decorator pattern allows for behavior to be added to individual objects, statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. This project enhances a simple file reading operation with additional functionality like logging.

## Project Structure

The project consists of several components that interact to demonstrate the use of the Decorator pattern:

### IContentReader Interface

- **Purpose**: Defines a contract with a single method `ReadContent()` that must be implemented by any class that intends to read content. This setup allows for different implementations of content reading, which can be from a file or any other source.

### FileReader Class

- **Purpose**: A concrete implementation of the `IContentReader` interface designed to read content from a file. It encapsulates the logic to read content from the specified file at instantiation.

### ContentReaderDecorator Abstract Class

- **Purpose**: Serves as a base class for all decorators. It holds a reference to an `IContentReader` object and delegates the reading to this object, while having the capability to add additional behavior.

### LoggingReader Class

- **Purpose**: A concrete decorator that enhances the `ReadContent()` method by adding logging before and after reading the file content. It logs the start and successful completion of the reading process.

## Usage

To use the decorated file reader:

1. Ensure there is a text file named `example.txt` in the same directory as the executable or provide the path to a different file in the `Program.cs` main method.
2. Run the program. The output will include logs indicating the progress of file reading and then display the content of the file.

## Benefits of Using the Decorator Pattern

- **Flexibility**: Decorators provide a flexible way to add or change the responsibilities of objects at runtime without altering the underlying objects permanently.
- **Extensibility**: New functionality can be introduced without affecting existing systems.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Decorators help keep each class focused on a specific responsibility and make the system easier to understand and maintain.

## Potential Extensions

- Additional decorators can be implemented to add more functionalities such as error handling, data transformation (e.g., encryption), and more detailed logging.

## Conclusion

This project illustrates how the Decorator pattern can be effectively utilized to enhance functionality in a modular and scalable way. By separating concerns and allowing for dynamic extensions, it makes the system more adaptable and maintainable.
