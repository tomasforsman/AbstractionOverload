# File Reader Application with Domain Driven Design

## Overview

This application demonstrates Domain Driven Design (DDD) by modeling a simple file reading utility. It focuses on the core domain concepts of text files and encapsulates file operations as domain behaviors.

## Components

- **TextFile**: A domain entity that represents a text file. It encapsulates the file path and content as well as the behaviors for loading and displaying the content.

- **FileService**: An application service that handles high-level operations involving `TextFile` objects. It orchestrates the loading and displaying of file content.

## Usage

The application's entry point is the `Program` class, which utilizes `FileService` to manage text file operations. This separation ensures that the domain logic remains isolated from other application concerns.

## Why Use Domain Driven Design?

DDD helps in managing complex designs by closely aligning the software with domain complexities. It facilitates collaboration between technical and domain experts, resulting in software that truly meets user needs and expectations.

## How to Run

Compile the C# code with a suitable .NET compiler and run the executable. Ensure the specified file (`example.txt`) is in the same directory as the executable or update the file path accordingly. The application will display the content of the file or an error message if the file cannot be found or read.
