# File Reader Application with Event Sourcing Pattern

## Overview

This application demonstrates the Event Sourcing Pattern by capturing and storing file-related events and processing them in sequence. It allows the application to reconstruct the state of a file operation or audit changes over time.

## Components

- **FileEventStore**: Stores all file-related events.

- **IFileEvent**: Interface that all file events implement. Each event knows how to process itself.

- **FileOpenedEvent and FileReadEvent**: Specific events that perform operations such as opening and reading a file.

- **FileProcessor**: Uses the `FileEventStore` to replay events, effectively reconstructing and reenacting the file operations.

## Usage

The application simulates file operations by creating events and storing them in `FileEventStore`. It then uses `FileProcessor` to replay these events, demonstrating how the state of the system (file operations) can be reconstructed from event logs.

## Why Use Event Sourcing?

Event Sourcing provides a robust audit trail for applications, allowing them to trace back and understand every change in state through events. It is particularly useful for systems where such auditing is crucial, like financial systems or order management systems.

## How to Run

Compile the C# code with a suitable .NET compiler and run the executable. The application will simulate opening and reading a file by processing stored events.
