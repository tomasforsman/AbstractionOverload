# BaseApp - Interpreter Pattern Implementation

## Overview
This README explains the implementation of the Interpreter pattern in the `BaseApp` project. We have used this pattern to evaluate arithmetic expressions read from a file, demonstrating how to interpret these expressions according to a defined grammar.

## Components
- **IExpression**: The core interface for all expressions in our grammar.
- **NumberExpression**: Implements `IExpression` to represent integer values in the expressions.
- **PlusExpression**: Also implements `IExpression`, handling the addition of two sub-expressions.

## Why Use the Interpreter Pattern?
The Interpreter pattern is ideal for scenarios where a system needs to interpret sentences of a language or expressions based on a predefined grammar. In our application, it enables the dynamic interpretation of arithmetic expressions, which users can define and modify without altering the program's codebase, adhering to the Open/Closed principle.

## Conclusion
The Interpreter pattern offers a structured approach to parse and interpret language constructs, providing flexibility and scalability in handling various types of expressions. It allows the application to extend supported expressions effortlessly, maintaining ease of maintenance and expansion.

## Usage
To use the application:
1. Place an arithmetic expression, such as "3 + 4", in `example.txt`.
2. Run the program to evaluate the expression and display the result.

This example covers the basic usage of the Interpreter pattern for simple arithmetic operations. For more complex grammars involving different types of operations and more intricate expression handling, the grammar and parser can be expanded accordingly.
