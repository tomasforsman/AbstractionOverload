# BaseApp - Iterator Pattern Implementation

## Overview
This README describes the implementation of the Iterator Pattern in the BaseApp project. The Iterator Pattern is used to read and process the contents of a text file line by line, which is helpful for handling large files or processing individual lines of text efficiently.

## Components
- **FileLineIterator**: The iterator that handles the traversal of each line in the file.
- **FileLines**: The iterable collection that returns the FileLineIterator for a given file.

## Why Use the Iterator Pattern?
The Iterator Pattern allows for a clean and flexible way to access or traverse the elements of a collection (in this case, lines of a file) without exposing the underlying representation. It supports operations like enumeration and removal of current elements while abstracting the details of access, which simplifies client code and makes it more manageable.

## Benefits
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Separates the business logic of iterating over data from the user interface.
- **Flexibility**: Makes the program more adaptable to changes in the way data is accessed or stored.
- **Memory Efficiency**: More efficient memory usage for large files since it reads one line at a time.

## Usage
To use the application, place your text file in the same directory as the executable or specify the correct path to `example.txt`. Run the program to read and print the contents line by line.

## Conclusion
Using the Iterator Pattern in this application facilitates easier management and modification of how files are read and processed, showcasing the pattern's utility in designing easily maintainable code.
