# MVC Pattern File Reader

## Overview
This project demonstrates the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern adapted into a simple file reading application. MVC is a pattern that separates application logic into three interconnected components, each with distinct responsibilities.

## Components
- **Model (FileModel)**: Handles data and business logic, reading files and storing content or errors.
- **View (FileView)**: Responsible for the output of file contents to the console.
- **Controller (FileController)**: Mediates input, converting it to commands for the Model or View.

## Usage
1. Update the `filePath` in the `Main` method of `Program` to the target file path.
2. Run the application to see how MVC separates concerns and manages interactions.

## Benefits of MVC
- **Separation of Concerns**: Decouples data access and business logic from user interface (UI), allowing independent development, testing, and maintenance.
- **Flexibility**: Each component can be independently modified or replaced as needed without affecting other components.
- **Scalability**: Facilitates scaling the application by providing a clear roadmap for where different types of logic and functionalities should be added.

## Conclusion
This MVC implementation showcases a fundamental organizational pattern suitable for applications ranging from simple to complex, promoting maintainable and scalable software development.
