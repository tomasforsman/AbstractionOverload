# Simple File Reader Application

This application demonstrates the "Package by Feature" design pattern, where software organization is based on features rather than technical layers. This modular approach encapsulates all items related to a specific feature in one package, improving maintainability and scalability.

## Feature Structure

- **FileReaderFeature**: Contains all components related to file reading.
    - **IFileReader.cs**: Defines the interface for file reading operations.
    - **FileReader.cs**: Implements the file reading logic with two classes:
        - **ConcreteFileReader**: Handles reading files if they exist.
        - **NullFileReader**: Provides a default response if a file does not exist, following the Null Object Pattern.
    - **Program.cs**: Main entry point that utilizes the file reader to perform its function.

## Benefits

- **Cohesion**: Each package is highly cohesive and contains all necessary components related to a feature.
- **Decoupling**: Features are decoupled from each other, making the system easier to understand and modify.
- **Scalability**: New features can be added with minimal impact on existing features.
- **Maintainability**: Related components are kept close, making it easier to manage and update them.

## How It Works

The main program initializes a `ConcreteFileReader` to read from a specified file path. If the file exists, the reader outputs its content; if not, the `NullFileReader` takes over, providing a predefined message, demonstrating robust error handling encapsulated within the feature.
