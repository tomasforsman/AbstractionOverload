# Simple File Reader Application

This application demonstrates the use of the Prototype Pattern in a simple C# file reader. The Prototype Pattern allows for copying existing objects to avoid the overhead of creating them from scratch, which is useful when object creation is costly.

## Implementation Details

- **IFileReaderPrototype Interface**: Defines methods for cloning and reading files. It ensures that all file reader implementations can be cloned and used to read files.

- **ConcreteFileReader Class**: Implements the `IFileReaderPrototype` by providing functionality to read files if they exist and supports cloning itself using a shallow copy mechanism.

- **Program Class**: The main entry point for the application. It initializes a prototype of `ConcreteFileReader`, clones it, and uses the clone to read a file.

## How It Works

1. The application initializes an instance of `ConcreteFileReader`.
2. This instance is cloned to create a new `IFileReaderPrototype` object.
3. The cloned object is used to read the file specified by the file path.

The use of the Prototype Pattern allows the application to minimize resource use by cloning an existing object instead of creating a new one each time a file needs to be read.
