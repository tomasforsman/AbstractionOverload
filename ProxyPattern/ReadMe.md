# Proxy Pattern File Reader

## Overview
This project implements the Proxy design pattern to manage file reading operations. The Proxy pattern provides an object that controls access to another object, adding a layer of functionality such as caching, control, or complexity reduction.

## Implementation Details
- **IFileReader Interface**: An interface that the real subject and proxy must implement, defining the `ReadFile` method.
- **RealFileReader**: The real subject that reads content from the file system.
- **CachedFileReader**: A proxy that adds caching to the file reading process. It prevents unnecessary disk reads by storing file content after the first read and reusing it on subsequent requests.

## Usage
To use this application:
1. Specify the file path in the `Main` method.
2. Run the application. The `CachedFileReader` will demonstrate caching by reading the file content from disk on the first call and returning the cached content on subsequent calls.

## Advantages of the Proxy Pattern
- **Efficiency**: Improves performance and efficiency by introducing caching, reducing the number of disk reads.
- **Control**: Adds a level of control over how and when a real object is accessed.
- **Security**: Can provide additional security layers by validating input before passing it to the real object.

## Conclusion
The Proxy pattern in this application showcases how additional functionalities like caching can be integrated seamlessly to enhance performance and control access to file reading operations, demonstrating the pattern’s utility in resource management and optimization.
