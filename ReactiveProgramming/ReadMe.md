# File Reader App Using Reactive Programming

## Introduction

This version of the file reader application is refactored to use Reactive Programming, leveraging the Reactive Extensions (Rx) library. Reactive Programming allows handling data streams and propagations of change efficiently, which is ideal for applications that must respond to dynamic data in real time.

## Components

### `fileObservable`

- **Responsibility**: Creates an observable sequence that checks if a file exists and reads its contents.
- **Behavior**: If the file exists, it reads and pushes the content to its subscribers. If the file doesn't exist or an error occurs during reading, it pushes an error notification.

## Advantages

- **Asynchronous and Event-Based**: By converting the file reading operation into an observable, the application handles it in an asynchronous, non-blocking manner.
- **Error Handling**: Errors are handled as part of the data stream, allowing subscribers to react appropriately.
- **Composability**: Multiple operations (like transformations and filters) can be composed and chained on the data stream, making the application highly flexible and extensible.

## Usage

The application sets up an observable sequence for reading a file. Subscribers to this sequence will receive the file content if available, or an error message if the file does not exist or an error occurs. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where data might change frequently or needs to be processed as soon as it becomes available.
