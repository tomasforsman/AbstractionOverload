# File Reader with Strategy Pattern

This project demonstrates the use of the Strategy Pattern to manage different processing behaviors for the content read from a file. The Strategy Pattern allows the behavior of an application to be selected at runtime, making the application more flexible and easier to extend with new behaviors.

## Project Structure

The project consists of several key components:

### IContentProcessor Interface

- **Purpose**: Defines a common interface for all processing strategies. Each strategy must implement the `ProcessContent` method that defines how the file content will be processed.

### Concrete Strategy Classes

- **PlainTextProcessor**: Implements the `IContentProcessor` interface to output the text as it is read from the file.
- **UpperCaseProcessor**: Also implements the `IContentProcessor` interface, but converts the text to uppercase before outputting it. Additional strategies can be implemented similarly.

### ContentReader Class (Context)

- **Purpose**: Configured with a specific implementation of the `IContentProcessor` strategy, this class handles reading the file content and delegating the processing to the strategy object.

## Usage

To use this application:

1. Ensure there is a file named `example.txt` in the same directory as your executable, or adjust the `filePath` in the `Program.cs` main method to match the location of your file.
2. Modify the `Main` method in `Program.cs` to select the desired strategy (e.g., `PlainTextProcessor` or `UpperCaseProcessor`).
3. Run the application. Depending on the chosen strategy, the file content will be processed and displayed accordingly.

## Benefits of Using the Strategy Pattern

- **Flexibility**: Allows the algorithm used to process content to be selected at runtime, making the application adaptable to different needs without modifying the core code.
- **Decoupling of Implementation**: Strategies can be developed and extended independently from the clients that use them.
- **Interchangeable Behaviors**: Different behaviors can be switched easily at runtime, facilitating dynamic behavior changes in the application.

## Extending the Application

To extend the functionality of this application, you can:

- Implement new strategies for different types of content processing, such as formatting, encryption, or compression.
- Enhance the `ContentReader` class to support more complex file operations, like reading from multiple sources or handling different file formats.

## Conclusion

This project illustrates a practical application of the Strategy Pattern in a simple file reading system. By using different strategies to process file content, the system becomes more modular, maintainable, and ready for future expansions or modifications.
