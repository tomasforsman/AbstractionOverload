# File Reader App Using Task-Based Asynchronous Pattern

## Introduction

This version of the file reader application implements the Task-Based Asynchronous Pattern (TAP). TAP leverages the `Task` and `Task<TResult>` types from the .NET Framework to represent asynchronous operations, using `await` to handle these operations asynchronously.

## Components

### `Main` Method

- **Responsibility**: The entry point of the application, orchestrates the asynchronous reading of a file.
- **Behavior**: Calls the `ReadFileContentAsync` method and handles its result asynchronously.

### `ReadFileContentAsync`

- **Responsibility**: Asynchronously reads the content of the file specified by the path.
- **Implementation**: Checks if the file exists and reads its contents asynchronously, using `StreamReader`. If the file does not exist, it throws a `FileNotFoundException`.

## Advantages

- **Non-blocking I/O Operations**: Using async-await for file I/O operations prevents the application's main thread from being blocked. This is particularly beneficial for UI applications or services where responsiveness is crucial.
- **Simplified Error Handling**: By using exceptions and async-await, error handling can be integrated into the natural flow of the code, making the logic clearer and more maintainable.
- **Scalability**: Asynchronous methods scale better when applied to operations bound by I/O, allowing more efficient use of server resources, especially under load.

## Usage

The application is simple to use and handle. It tries to read a file and outputs its contents. If the file is not found, it catches a `FileNotFoundException` and informs the user. This pattern is well-suited for applications dealing with I/O-bound operations where responsiveness and scalability are of concern.
