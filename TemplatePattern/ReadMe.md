# File Reader Application with Template Method Pattern

## Overview

This application demonstrates the use of the Template Method Design Pattern in a file processing application. The pattern allows defining the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses. This lets subclasses redefine certain steps of the algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.

## Components

- **FileProcessor**: An abstract class that defines the template method `ProcessFile`. This method outlines the steps for processing a file, with hooks (`ReadFile`, `ProcessContent`, and `HandleFileNotFound`) that can be customized by subclasses.

- **DisplayFileProcessor**: A concrete implementation of `FileProcessor` that defines how to process the file's content. Other behaviors related to file reading and error handling can also be overridden if needed.

## Usage

The `Program` class uses the `FileProcessor` class to process a file. It demonstrates how the application can adapt to different file processing strategies by extending `FileProcessor`.

## Why Use the Template Method Pattern?

The Template Method Pattern is useful for scenarios where an algorithm can be decomposed into common parts that are invariant and parts that are variable. By encapsulating these parts in a class with a specific algorithm in a method, it becomes easy to extend and adapt the algorithm by overriding certain steps.

## How to Run

Compile the C# code with a suitable compiler and run the executable. The application reads a specified file and processes it according to the defined steps in the `DisplayFileProcessor` class.
