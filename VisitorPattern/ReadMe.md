# FileProcessor Project using Visitor Pattern

This project demonstrates the implementation of the Visitor Pattern in a simple C# application designed to perform operations on files. The Visitor Pattern allows for new operations to be added without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

1. **IFileElement Interface**
    - Defines the `Accept` method that takes a visitor object as an argument.

2. **Concrete Element**
    - `TextFile`: Represents a specific type of file that implements the `IFileElement` interface. It has a method to accept a visitor that then performs operations specific to the file type.

3. **IFileVisitor Interface**
    - An interface for visitors, declaring a visit method for each type of file element.

4. **Concrete Visitor**
    - `FileReaderVisitor`: Implements the `IFileVisitor` interface to read the contents from a text file.

### Visitor Pattern Usage

- **Separation of Concerns**: The pattern helps in separating the algorithm from the object structure on which it operates. This enhances the maintainability and scalability of the codebase.
- **Adding Operations**: It simplifies adding new operations on elements without changing the classes on which they operate.
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each visitor class can be modified independently of other visitors when changes are needed.

## Usage

Run the `Program.cs` to see how the `FileReaderVisitor` reads contents from a specified text file (`example.txt`). The visitor is dynamically passed to the file element, which then delegates the reading operation back to the visitor.

## Conclusion

The Visitor Pattern provides a powerful way to organize operations on complex object structures, making it easy to add new operations without altering the objects' structures. This project provides a basic framework for how to use and implement the Visitor Pattern in C# applications.
